# MemAI

A long-term memory MCP server for AI agents. Agents call its tools to write
memories (facts, decisions, checkpoints, pitfalls) during a session and read
them back in future sessions — the thing that lets an agent "remember" across
process restarts, since an MCP server's own process does not persist state
between conversations on its own.

## Why this exists

Vector-database-backed memory stores usually couple two things that don't
like being coupled: an ANN vector index (e.g. HNSW) and a separate metadata
store, each with its own durability model. An agent host that manages MCP
servers as subprocesses typically kills them abruptly at session end, not
cleanly — and a kill that lands between the metadata write and the index
flush desyncs the two. The failure mode is silent: search still returns
results, just increasingly wrong ones (stale, or referencing entries that no
longer exist). This isn't hypothetical — e.g. Chroma 0.5.7–0.5.12 lost
not-yet-synced embeddings while keeping their documents
([chroma#2922](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues/2922)).

MemAI avoids the failure class differently: vectors live *inside* the same
transactional store as everything else. There is no second store with its
own durability model, so there is nothing to desync from.

## How it works

**Storage.** A single SQLite file, WAL mode, holding six things together in
one transactional unit:
- `memories` — the rows themselves (type, domain, session, tags, content,
  status, confidence, timestamps).
- `memories_fts` — an FTS5 (BM25, porter-stemmed) full-text index over
  content + tags + domain, kept in sync with `memories` via triggers on
  every insert/update/delete.
- `memories_vec` — a [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec)
  `vec0` table holding one embedding per memory (over the same
  content + tags + domain text FTS indexes). sqlite-vec hooks SQLite's
  transaction lifecycle, so vector writes commit/roll back with the row
  they belong to.
- `edits` — full edit history; correcting a memory keeps the previous
  version instead of overwriting it.
- `relations` — a queryable graph of typed edges between memories
  (`supersedes`, `relates_to`, `contradicts`, ...).
- `meta` — which embedding model (and dimension) produced the stored
  vectors.

Because everything lives in one file under one set of ACID transactions,
there's nothing that can desync from anything else, including across a hard
kill — SQLite's WAL journal guarantees the file is either fully committed or
rolled back, never half-written. That includes the vectors: no ANN index
sitting beside the database waiting for a clean shutdown.

**Embeddings.** A local [model2vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec)
static model (`minishlab/potion-base-8M`, ~30MB, numpy-only CPU inference)
ships bundled inside the package — no Hugging Face download and no network
access required, which matters on corporate networks that block
huggingface.co. Set `MEMAI_EMBED_MODEL` to a Hugging Face repo id or a local
path to use a different model instead. Embedding versioning is handled
explicitly: the `meta` table records
the model name + dimension, and if either changes, all vectors are dropped
and re-embedded in one transaction on the next connect — vectors from one
model are meaningless in another model's space. If the model can't load
(e.g. first run offline), writes proceed without vectors and retrieval
degrades to keyword-only (relevant only if `MEMAI_EMBED_MODEL` points
somewhere unreachable); missing vectors are backfilled automatically on a
later connect.

**Retrieval.** `search` is hybrid: FTS5 BM25 across content/tags/domain,
plus brute-force KNN (cosine, no ANN index — nothing to desync, and at
memory-store scale linear scan is plenty) over the vectors, merged by
reciprocal rank fusion. Each result says which side matched
(`match_source`: `fts` | `vec` | `both`) and carries the raw scores
(`fts_rank`, `vec_distance`). Both retrievers only *widen the candidate
set* — semantic judgment (does this candidate actually answer the query)
is still left to the calling agent: it reads back the candidates and
decides relevance itself, the same way it would judge any other tool's
output. Multi-term queries are OR'd together on the keyword side, so
several paraphrases in one call still help. `list_by_domain` /
`list_recent` exist as a brute-force fallback for when a search comes back
thin.

**Recency vs. similarity.** `pulse` and the `list_*` tools always sort by
`created_at DESC` — never by similarity. Similarity ranking exists only
inside `search`, where it orders *candidates* for the agent to judge, not
answers. A similarity-ranked top-1 can surface an old memory that happens
to score well over a same-day one that's actually current, which is exactly
why the "what's the latest state" tools stay recency-only.

**Confirmation-gated deletion.** `forget` is a soft delete: content is kept,
the row is just excluded from default search/list output (`status:
archived`). `purge_memory` is a real, permanent delete of the row plus its
edit history and relations — gated on a `confirm_phrase` argument that must
exactly equal `"DELETE <uid>"`. The intent is that this string can only
plausibly come from a human explicitly confirming that exact id in their own
words, not from an agent inferring "the user probably wants this deleted."

## Tools

An agent can discover all of this at runtime: `help()` returns every
tool with a one-line summary, and `help(command='<name>')` returns that
tool's full signature and docstring, read live from the code.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `note(content, domain, tags, session)` | Save a fact/decision/finding (`type='note'`) |
| `checkpoint(intent, established, pursuing, open_questions, session, domain)` | Save work state; fields are free-length |
| `anti_pattern(pattern, why_wrong, instead, domain, session)` | Save a pitfall to avoid repeating |
| `reasoning(content, domain, session)` | Save a reasoning trace (`type='reasoning'`) |
| `handoff(content, domain, session)` | Leave a note for another agent/session |
| `search(query, domain, type, limit)` | Hybrid BM25 + vector search, source-annotated |
| `recall(query, domain, limit)` | Relevance-ranked recall of `note()`'d knowledge (search scoped to `type='note'`) |
| `list_by_domain(domain, type, limit)` | Recency-ordered list, scoped to a domain |
| `list_recent(type, domain, limit)` | Recency-ordered list, global |
| `list_domains()` | Distinct domains with counts + latest activity (warm-up discovery) |
| `pulse(domain)` | Session warm-up: latest checkpoint + open handoffs/anti-patterns + recent notes |
| `get_memory(uid)` | Full record, including edit history and relations |
| `edit_memory(uid, new_content, note)` | Correct a memory, keeping the prior version |
| `link_memories(from_uid, to_uid, relation_type, note)` | Create a typed relation between two memories |
| `get_relations(uid)` | List relations for a memory |
| `set_confidence(uid, confidence)` | `unverified` \| `confirmed` \| `contradicted` |
| `dedup_scan(domain, type, threshold, limit)` | Surface likely-duplicate candidate pairs by lexical overlap, for the agent to review |
| `forget(uid, reason, superseded_by)` | Soft delete (archive, reversible) |
| `purge_memory(uid, confirm_phrase)` | Hard delete, requires an explicit user-stated `"DELETE <uid>"` |
| `help(command)` | Tool docs read live from the code's docstrings; no arg = one-line summary of everything |

Writer tool names match the `type` they store (`note()` → `type='note'`,
`reasoning()` → `type='reasoning'`, ...), so the verb an agent calls is
exactly the string it later filters on.

## Setup

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/pip install -e ".[dev]"   # or .venv/bin/pip on non-Windows
pytest
```

On Windows, `install.bat` does the venv + install steps and
`run-admin.bat` starts the admin dashboard (both activate `.venv`
themselves; extra arguments are passed through, e.g.
`run-admin.bat --port 8890`).

Register it as an MCP server (e.g. in a Claude Desktop / Claude Code MCP
config) pointing at the installed console script:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memai": {
      "command": "memai-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Admin dashboard

`memai-admin` (or `python -m memai.admin`) serves a local web dashboard
over the same store, at `http://127.0.0.1:8765` (loopback
only; `--host`/`--port`/`MEMAI_ADMIN_PORT` to change). It is the human
curation surface for everything the MCP tools do, plus the operations that
only make sense for a person:

- **Overview** — live counts, confidence meter, per-type distribution,
  30-day activity, vector coverage.
- **Memories** — hybrid search + filters (type/domain/status/confidence/
  session), a per-memory record drawer (edit content with history, edit
  metadata with re-embedding, confidence triage, archive/restore,
  relations, line-level diffs of past edits, guarded purge), and
  multi-select bulk actions.
- **Graph** — force-layout of the relations graph; drag, zoom, click to
  inspect, and a link mode to create relations between two nodes.
- **Domains** — counts per domain, rename/merge (every affected row is
  re-embedded and audited), and spelling-drift detection
  (`PROJ-1042` vs `proj-1042`).
- **Maintenance** — integrity/FTS/vector health checks, FTS rebuild,
  vector backfill/re-embed, orphan cleanup, VACUUM, timestamped backups
  (`VACUUM INTO`), a dedup-candidate review queue, and the audit trail.

It runs on Starlette + uvicorn, both already present as dependencies of
the `mcp` SDK — no new requirements. Destructive-action parity with the
MCP tools is kept: archiving is the default "delete", and purging demands
the literal `DELETE <uid>` phrase typed into the UI.

## Data location

`%MEMAI_HOME%/memai.db` if the `MEMAI_HOME` environment variable is set,
otherwise `~/.memai/memai.db`. Not tracked in git — it's user data, created
on first run.

The default embedding model ships inside the package (`src/memai/models/`)
so this is offline, CPU-only from the first run — no download, no
huggingface-hub cache. Only an explicit `MEMAI_EMBED_MODEL` override that
names a Hugging Face repo id touches the network (and then caches under
`~/.cache/huggingface`, same as before).
