"""memai admin dashboard -- local web UI over the memory store.

A Starlette + uvicorn app (both already shipped as dependencies of the
`mcp` SDK, so this adds no new requirements) exposing a JSON API over
db.py plus a single-page UI, built from webui/ by Vite into
webui/dist/ and served from there. It is a *maintenance*
surface: everything the MCP tools can do, plus operations that only
make sense for a human curator -- bulk confidence triage, domain
renames/merges, relation pruning, dedup review, FTS rebuilds,
VACUUM/backup, and an audit trail over the edits table.

Handlers are written synchronously against db.py, and `api` runs each
one in a worker thread. The whole handler -- connect, work, commit --
stays on one thread, which preserves both db.py's
one-transaction-per-connect model and sqlite3's same-thread rule. It
also keeps a slow handler off the event loop, so a scan does not stop
the server from answering anything else (see maintenance/dedup).

Destructive parity with the MCP tools is kept: archive (forget) is the
default "delete", and purge demands the literal confirmation phrase
"DELETE <uid>" typed by the operator, same guardrail as server.py. A
whole domain reads the same way one memory does -- archiving it is the
reversible option, and deleting it asks for "DELETE <domain>".

Run with `memai-admin` (default http://127.0.0.1:8888); binds to
loopback unless --host says otherwise. Honors MEMAI_HOME.
