"""What memai emits when a host fires one of its hooks.

Three events, each reading the host's hook payload on stdin and writing one
JSON object on stdout:

  session-start   the store's state, and the instruction to open the subject
  pre-compact     a reminder to checkpoint before the context is summarised
  stop            a nudge to checkpoint when nothing was written, and a
                  request for the warden subagent when one is owed

A fourth reads the call the host is about to make instead of the store, and
is the one exception to everything the last paragraph of this docstring says:

  guard           refuses a memai write whose required text never arrived

One more subcommand reads the store the same way and writes plain text
instead:

  statusline      the store in a single line, for a host's status line

`memai-hook install` registers the four events in the user's settings, and
`install --skills` / `install --agents` copy the bundled skills and subagent
definitions into place, rather than emitting anything -- see
memai.hook_install.

No MCP: the SQLite store is opened directly, so a hook needs no server to be
running and no tool to have been loaded.

Every failure path exits 0 with no output -- no store, an unreadable one, a
payload that is not JSON, an unknown event -- so a hook cannot stop the
session it is attached to. `guard` is the deliberate exception: stopping the
call IS what it is for, and it exits 2 to do it. It never reads the store,
so the only way it can fail is by refusing, and it refuses only on a payload
it read and understood.
