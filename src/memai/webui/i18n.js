/* MemAI admin i18n runtime.
   String catalogs live in public/i18n/<locale>.json — one file per language,
   copied verbatim into the build and fetched from /static/i18n at runtime.
   Adding a language = drop public/i18n/<code>.json + add one LOCALES entry.
   Only English (the fallback) and the active locale are fetched.
   The user's choice persists in localStorage and a switch reloads the
   page, so module-level constants in app.js can bake translations at
   load time. Convention: strings that end up in innerHTML may carry
   markup; callers esc() any user-provided value BEFORE interpolating. */

   "Archives {n} {n?memory:memories}" reads correctly at one and at three,

   `vars`, not by the interpolated text: callers pass counts through fmtInt,
   which inserts the locale's group separator, and a bare Number() reads
   "1.000" as one. The digits are taken out of the value first, so every
   grouped count agrees with the count. Anything that is not exactly one
   takes `many`, zero included -- English and Portuguese both say
   "0 memories". A count the caller did not pass takes `many` as well,
