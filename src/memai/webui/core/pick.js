/* A <select> replacement: a button, and a listbox in a popover.

   Not for the sake of a different widget. A native <option> renders as text
   and nothing else -- it takes no mark, no second line, no rail -- so every
   choice this app offers that is more than a word had to be flattened into
   one: a domain lost the tree it is, a memory type lost the colour the rest
   of the UI identifies it by, a confidence lost its ring. The popup was also
   the one surface in the app the stylesheet could not reach, so it arrived in
   the browser's own idea of a dark theme next to controls that were not.

   So the shell lives here -- button, panel, placement, the caret, the keys,
   dismissal -- and a caller supplies only what goes INSIDE a row. Nothing
   about a domain, a type or a shape is known at this level; see
   core/domain-picker.js for the row shape that made this worth extracting.

   ARIA follows the combobox pattern: the button owns aria-expanded, the
   panel is a listbox of options, and the caret is aria-activedescendant on
   whichever element has focus -- never focus itself, which has to stay in the
   filter field while the caret moves.

   One panel at a time, parented to <body> (a toolbar clips, a modal stacks)
   and dismissed by whatever you do next. */

   is the caller's business -- the domain picker keeps the ancestors of a match
   so its rails still have something to hang off, which no generic filter would
   have thought to do.

   Each item: { value, label, html?, cls?, style?, title? }. `label` is the
   text the filter matches and what the button shows once it is picked; `html`
   is the row's insides when they are more than that text.

   `search` defaults to a row count -- see SEARCH_FROM. `onPick` gets the
   value; a picker that stands for a form field also repaints the button,
   which is why the item is handed over with it.

   `anchor` is a selector for an ANCESTOR of the button, and the panel is then
   measured and placed against that element instead of the button: a control
   that is only the right-hand half of a row opens over the whole row, at the
   row's width. It is resolved when the panel opens, so a repaint of the row
   leaves no stale element behind.

   `align` is the edge the panel lines up with, 'left' (default) or 'right' --
   the right edge for a control that sits at the end of a bar, or whose own
   label is right-aligned inside its box. */
