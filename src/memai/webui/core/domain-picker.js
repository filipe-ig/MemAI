/* The domain filter: core/pick.js with the tree drawn into its rows.

   A domain is a path, so the choice is a TREE -- and this is the control that
   made a popover worth building at all. An <option> renders as text, which
   leaves a native select two ways to say so and no third. Plain indentation
   says how DEEP a row is and not what it hangs off, which is the whole
   question in a store where forty siblings share a parent. Box-drawing
   characters say it, but they need a monospaced face to line up at all and
   still read as ASCII art wedged into a native control -- that shipped once
   and came straight back out.

   So the rows carry the same CSS rails as the Domains table, off the same
   shape function, and the two cannot come to disagree about the tree. The
   filter field is always on rather than at pick.js's own threshold: sixty
   domains under one parent is the normal case here, and typing is what
   actually finds one -- no amount of drawing would have. */
