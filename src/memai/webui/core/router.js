/* Hash router.

   This module deliberately imports no view. app.js owns the view table
   and hands it over through registerViews() -- otherwise router and views
   would import each other, and the deep-link hook (open a record drawer
   on top of any view) would drag the drawer in here too.

   Renders are generation-counted. Two navigations in quick succession
   used to race: both awaited their API call and both wrote to #view, so
   the SLOWER one painted last and the address bar disagreed with the
   screen. A render is now handed a ctx whose stale() says "someone has
   navigated past you, stop" -- checked by each view after its awaits and
   before its first write, and again here around the post-render steps. */
