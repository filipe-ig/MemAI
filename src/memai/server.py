"""memai MCP server.

Tools for long-term agent memory: note/checkpoint/anti_pattern/
reasoning/handoff/diagram to write, search/recall/list_by_domain/
list_recent/timeline/list_domains/pulse to read, plus edit history, a relations
graph, a dedup-candidate scanner, confidence/status tracking, and help()
for self-documentation straight from these docstrings. Retrieval is FTS5
(BM25) keyword search over one ACID SQLite file -- it only narrows
candidates, the calling agent judges relevance.

Writer tool names match the `type` value they store (note stores
type='note', reasoning stores type='reasoning', ...), so what an agent
calls is exactly what search/list_* filter on.

A memory's `domain` is the subject it belongs to, and subjects contain
subjects: write it as a path, outermost first -- 'acme/x100/p200' is a
routine inside a module inside a product. Every read that takes a domain
covers its subdomains too, so one call asks about a whole product or
about exactly one routine, depending on how much of the path it gives.
list_domains() returns the tree that exists.

diagram is the one type whose body is not prose: it stores a graph, one
row per step, and generates the prose the retrieval side indexes. Its
graph is edited through diagram_* and read back through get_diagram().

Everything above answers a call, and an MCP server cannot make an agent
call anything. Three things here exist for that gap: INSTRUCTIONS, which
the host may inject; the warm_up prompt, invoked by the person rather than
the agent; and the memai-hook CLI (memai.hook), which puts the store's
state in a session's context without any of this being running. Writes
carry a per-process `session` stamp unless one is passed.

    title: one line naming what this memory is about, in the words someone

    repeats the type ("note about the parser") names nothing. At most 120
    characters, and a name that needs more than that is summarizing the
    body instead of naming it.

    content: ONE fact, and what a reader needs to use it -- what holds,
    where it holds, what it rules out. Retrieval ranks whole memories, so a
    body answering four questions comes back for all four and is read for
    one: write the second subject as its own memory, on its own domain, and
    connect the two with link_memories(). A [[uid]] typed inside a body is
    a reference a reader can follow, not an edge -- get_relations() and the
    graph do not see it until link_memories() creates one. Past a couple of
    thousand characters, a body is usually several memories written as one.

    domain: the subject this belongs to, as a path from the outermost
    scope in ('acme/x100/p200'). File it as deep as the fact is specific
    -- a note about one routine goes on the routine, and still comes back
    when someone asks about the module or the product above it.

    also: other domain paths this belongs to, comma-separated. `domain` is
    where the memory LIVES -- one path, one parent chain. `also` is for the
    subjects that cut ACROSS that tree: the same routine belongs to the
    module it runs in and to the end-to-end flow it is one step of, and
    neither of those is the other's ancestor. Every read scoped to any of
    those paths returns it. A path that `domain` already sits under is
    dropped as redundant -- the result echoes what was stored.

    tags: comma-separated keywords and synonyms. Retrieval is BM25 over
    content, tags and domain paths, and tags weigh second only to the body,
    so they are where a memory becomes findable by words its own text never
    uses -- the identifier, the symbol, the error string, the plain-language
    phrasing someone will actually type. A memory with none is reachable
    only by quoting itself.

    review_after: when this stops being safe to trust unchecked, as a date
    ('2026-11-01') or a span from today ('90d'). pulse() counts what is
    overdue in a scope as `scope.stale` and optimize_scan lists it. Leave
    it empty for anything that does not go stale -- most facts do not, and
    a date nobody meant is worse than none.

    source_ref: what the fact came FROM -- a path, a URL, a table name --
    so a later pass can check the claim against the thing itself instead

    separate object that can carry its own explanation and its own links
    to other memories, which is what makes a diagram the source of truth
    for its domain instead of one more wall of prose.

    Keep every `label` objective -- what happens at that step, nothing

    nodes: [{"key": "load", "label": "Read the export window",

    shape: start|step|decision|io|end. Exactly one 'start' is required

    retry loop is a real flow, not a mistake.

    also: other domain paths this flow belongs to, comma-separated. `domain`

    ACROSS routines -- several of them can be steps of one end-to-end

    a pasted identifier names) and fts_rank (bm25, lower = better). The
    search only widens the candidate set -- judge the returned candidates
    yourself.

    SPEND TERMS FREELY. Every space-separated term is asked for separately
    and a row matching more of them ranks higher, so piling on synonyms,
    the identifier, the routine name and the plain-language phrasing into
    one query costs one call and finds strictly more. Twenty terms beat
    ten. Write a sentence if that is what you have -- common words score
    near zero and cost nothing, so there is nothing to strip.

    Only active memories by default.

    record; a result's `est_tokens` estimates what that full record costs,
    and the top-level `est_tokens` is the sum over the results.

    Two annotations worth acting on. `succeeded_by` means something in the
    store supersedes this memory: read that one instead. `collapsed` lists
    near-identical results folded into this one, so a fact written five
    times spends one slot -- raise `limit` if you want the copies.

    A memory marked confidence='contradicted' sorts behind everything that
    still holds, but it does come back: knowing a claim was ruled out is
    worth a slot, and it is what stops it being written again.

    A diagram ranks like any other memory: it comes back when it matches
    the query, in the position its score earns. Nothing lifts a type to the
    top, so a flow in the results is a flow this query actually hit -- and
    when one does show up it is worth opening first, because it states a
    whole routine the surrounding notes only annotate.

    type filters (one writer each): 'note', 'reasoning', 'checkpoint',
    'anti_pattern', 'handoff', 'diagram'. Ask for type='diagram' to sweep
    the documented flows on purpose. To recall note()'d knowledge
    specifically, recall() is the sugar for search(type='note') -- which
    also means recall() never surfaces a diagram; use search() for that.

    latest_checkpoint is returned in full (that's the point of pulse),

    facts, as recency breadcrumbs -- for relevance-ranked recall use
    recall()/search(). Those three lists are snippet-truncated -- call

    latest_checkpoint and those three lists carry `est_tokens`, the

    what the get_memory(uid) would cost, on latest_checkpoint it is what
    this response already spent. `diagrams` has no bodies to price.

    diagrams lists the documented flows by title only, never inlined:
    a whole graph would swamp a warm-up. Read one with get_diagram(uid)
    when the work actually touches that routine.

    domain warms up a path and everything under it, so pulse('acme/x100')
    is the module-wide brief and pulse('acme/x100/p200') the routine's.
    A domain that names only the deep end of a path ('p200') is resolved
    to the branches it sits in -- `scope.paths` reports which, and an
    ambiguous name resolves to ALL of them.

    `scope` is the rest of the brief: what the scope HOLDS, next to what
    came back. This is a warm-up, so each list stops at a handful and the
    newest few of a busy child can fill it on their own -- `scope.not_shown`
    counts what that left behind, per type, and `scope.subdomains` says
    which level it is sitting in (`own` = filed there, `subtree` = with its
    descendants). Read them as the drill-down plan: search(query,
    domain=...) or list_by_domain(domain, type=..., limit=...) on the child
    that holds what this pass only counted. A pulse is the state of a
    scope, never its contents.

    `scope.stale` is the one thing here about DECAY rather than contents:
    how many memories in the scope carry a `review_after` date that has
    passed. Present only when non-zero. It means somebody who knew the
    subject said when to look again and nobody has -- optimize_scan lists
    which ones, with their `source_ref`.

    A scope holds what is CROSS-LISTED into it as well as what is filed
    there, so warming up an end-to-end flow brings back the routines that
    are steps of it wherever they live. `scope.also` counts how much of the
    brief arrived that way, and a subdomain carries its own `also` --
    present only when non-zero, so a store that never cross-lists never
    sees the field.

    title renames the memory: the one line a list shows it by, and the

    its title is part of what generates the body, so a rename here would be

    tags REPLACES the tag set, comma-separated: pass the whole set that

Dump the memory corpus compactly so you can plan a curation pass.

Step 1 of the "optimize my memories" workflow. Returns every memory's
curation-relevant fields, the relation edges among them, and
dedup-candidate pairs as a starting hint. Read this, then decide what
to compact/reword/retag/redomain/set_confidence/archive/link/merge/
distill and stage it with optimize_stage.

The listing is slim on purpose so a few-hundred-memory store fits one
response: content is a ~120-char snippet plus `content_len` (tags cut
at ~100 with `tags_len`); empty/default fields are omitted (incl.
confidence 'unverified' -- stats keeps the aggregate); created_at
drops sub-second precision. Pass full=True for whole
bodies, or fetch one with get_memory(uid) when a snippet is not
enough. A page also ends early if its serialized size hits an
internal budget, so one response ALWAYS fits the host's output cap.
`truncated: true` means the listing stopped before the corpus ended
-- page onward with offset = offset + count (stats.total is the
whole corpus).

On a grown store, prefer INCREMENTAL curation over full-corpus
passes: `since` limits the scan to memories created or updated
at/after an ISO timestamp or date ('2026-07-01'), so a recurring
"optimize my memories" only reviews the delta since the last run
(optimize_runs shows when that was). Cross-window collisions are
still caught: dedup_hints probe FROM the new memories against the
whole store (a new memory duplicating an old one outside the window
surfaces; old x old pairs are skipped), and domain_hints report any
store-wide domain cluster the delta touches. Combine with
domain/type to curate one slice at a time. Also included:
  - stats: totals for the whole filtered corpus (by_type,
    by_confidence, by_domain, empty_domain, untagged) -- computed
    regardless of `limit`. `untagged` counts the memories whose tags
    are empty or are nothing but their own type: BM25 reads content,
    tags and domain, so those answer only a query that quotes their
    own wording. They are the retag work list,
  - domain_hints: clusters of domain-string variants that likely mean
    the same thing (case/separator drift, ticket-id spellings), with
    a suggested canonical -- ready-made redomain candidates,
  - domain_nesting: flat domains that already spell a hierarchy out
    ('acme-x100-p200-cache-warmup'), each with the path it could
    become ('acme/x100/p200/cache-warmup'). Domains nest, and a
    scope only groups what is filed under it, so these are the
    redomain candidates that turn one string per subject into a tree.
    Read them as a proposal, not a verdict: the split cannot tell a
    real level from a hyphen inside a name, so check each one and
    stage only the splits that hold,
  - per memory, `also`: the domains it belongs to beside its own path.
    There is deliberately no hint listing cross-listing CANDIDATES --
    which subjects cut across the tree is a judgement about what the
    memories say, not something a string split can propose. Read the
    corpus, decide, and stage `crosslist` suggestions; `also` is there
    so you can tell a new membership from one that already holds,
  - anchors: per memory, the verifiable references found in its FULL
    content (URLs, file paths, table/field identifiers, constants),
    space-joined -- the things to go check against live facts.

Before proposing any change, CHECK IT AGAINST LIVE FACTS -- do not
rewrite or archive something that was true then but stale now, and do
not "correct" something that is still true:
  - cross-check newer memories already in this corpus (supersession /
    contradiction),
  - for code/config memories, verify the anchors against the live repo,
  - for world-facts, web-check current truth.
Record what you verified in each suggestion's `verified` field --
destructive suggestions (archive, set_confidence=contradicted) are
rejected without it.

Stage a batch of curation suggestions for human review in the dashboard.

Step 2 of the "optimize my memories" workflow. Writes the suggestions
to a new optimization run; they are NOT applied here -- the user
reviews and applies/rejects each one in the admin dashboard's
Optimization tab, where a backup is taken before the first apply and
every applied change can be undone.

Each suggestion is an object:
  {"kind": ..., "target_uid": ..., "payload": {...},
   "rationale": "why", "verified": "what live-facts check you did"}

Kinds and their payload:
  compact / reword   {"new_content": str}

  redomain           {"domain": str}
  crosslist          {"also": [path, ...]}         replaces the whole set
  set_confidence     {"confidence": "unverified|confirmed|contradicted"}
  review             {"review_after": str}         a date or a span ('180d'); '' clears it
  archive            {"reason": str}               soft/reversible; never hard-deletes
  link               {"from_uid", "to_uid", "relation_type", "note"?}
  merge              {"keep_uid", "drop_uid", "note"?}   links supersedes + archives drop
  distill            {"source_uids": [uid, ...], "new_type": "note|reasoning|anti_pattern",
                      "new_content": str, "title": str, "tags"?, "domain"?}

redomain moves where a memory is FILED -- one path, one parent chain.
crosslist sets what it also BELONGS to: the subjects that cut across
that tree, where several routines are each a step of one end-to-end
process without any of them being the parent of the others. It replaces
the whole set rather than adding to it, so include the memberships that
should survive; `also: []` drops them all. The corpus lists each
memory's current `also`, so read that before proposing. A path the
memory's own domain already sits under is redundant and is dropped --
if that leaves nothing, the suggestion is rejected rather than silently
staged as a clear.

distill extracts the durable knowledge out of one or MORE source
memories into a newly authored one: creates it, links it `supersedes`
each source and archives the sources (all reversible). Use it to
retire closed-ticket checkpoints without losing what they taught, or
as an n-ary merge when the survivor needs synthesized content. It is the
only kind that authors a memory, so it takes that memory's `title` the way
a writing tool does: no later step names it. Those payload keys are the
whole set it applies -- any other key is reported in `errors`. A diagram cannot be a source: its content is generated
from its graph, so retire a flow with archive instead.

link/merge derive target_uid from the payload (from_uid / drop_uid)
and distill creates its target -- omit target_uid for those kinds.
Destructive suggestions (archive, set_confidence=contradicted, merge,
distill) require a non-empty `verified` describing the live-facts
check that justifies them.

Invalid suggestions are skipped and reported in `errors`; the rest are
staged. Returns {run_id, staged, errors}.

`note` describes the whole run in at most 250 characters -- one or two
sentences, the shape of "what this pass did and why now". A longer note
raises and stages nothing. Per-suggestion detail goes in `rationale`
and `verified`, which have no limit; findings worth keeping go in a
memory, not in the run note.
""",
    "get_diagram": """
TO SHOW THE DIAGRAM TO A USER, pick by what you can actually do with it:

  * you can render inline HTML/SVG in your reply (a widget, an artifact, an
    inline preview) -> format='svg-interactive', then READ THE FILE at the
    returned `inline_path` and emit its contents inline. That file is the
    whole answer: a self-contained fragment with pan and zoom, no doctype,
    no <body>, no network, no external CSS, nothing that reaches the host
    page. (`path` is the same drawing as a standalone document, for opening
    in a browser or sending as a file -- do not paste that one inline, most
    renderers reject a full document.) Do NOT reach for mermaid here.
  * you can only attach or link a file -> format='svg'. Same drawing, no
    shell, openable in any browser or image viewer.
  * you can render neither, but your client draws mermaid natively ->
    format='mermaid'.

The file/payload split exists for the calls that do NOT display -- reasoning
over a flow, checking what a step says, handing a path to something else,
which is most of them. IT IS NOT A REASON TO AVOID EMITTING THE MARKUP WHEN
THE USER ASKED TO SEE THE DIAGRAM. In that case, reading the file and
putting its contents in your reply IS the deliverable, and the tokens it
costs are the cost of doing the work, not an overrun to economise on.

Attaching or linking the file is NOT showing it: that hands the user
something to open later. If your only display mechanism is a file send, at
least mark it to render rather than to download.

Fidelity, which is the reason the SVG formats exist: they reproduce the
admin canvas exactly -- the arrangement the user made, the same edge routing
around it, the same wrapped labels, node notes as <title> tooltips. MERMAID
DOES NOT. Mermaid always applies its own layout, so it discards the stored
positions and shows a flow the user never arranged. Prefer it only when
nothing else can be displayed.

'svg-interactive' over 'svg' for anything long: a 34-step routine is
~3000x6300 units, and scaled to fit a chat column that puts its labels under
3px. The interactive shell opens at a readable scale near the start step.

Each call also prunes older renders per the retention setting (see the
dashboard's maintenance view) and reports how many it removed.
