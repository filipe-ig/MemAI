"""SQLite-backed store for memai.

One store is one WAL-mode file holding memory rows, an FTS5 index, edit
history, a relations graph, and the node/edge tables behind type='diagram'
memories together under one set of ACID transactions, so there is nothing
that can desync from the metadata on a hard-kill. One such file is a
PROJECT: a home directory holds any number of them and names the one every
connect() opens by default -- see the project functions after SCHEMA.

Retrieval is FTS5 BM25 keyword search. It only widens the candidate set --
semantic judgment is left to the calling agent, which reads the candidates
back and decides relevance itself.

A store can carry a sqlite-vec virtual table, meta keys naming an embedding
model, and two usage counters beside via_fts. Nothing here reads them and
nothing registers the vec0 module, so _drop_vector_store removes all three
at connect time -- which is also what sanitizes a `VACUUM INTO` backup
carrying them, since a restore is a copy into place and nothing else.

# ACROSS the tree: the same routine belongs to the module it runs in and to
# the end-to-end flow it is a step of, and neither of those is the other's
# ancestor. `memory_domains` holds those extra memberships, one row per
# path, and every domain filter reads it (see domain_clause).

    belongs to -- and 'p200' matches no prefix once that routine lives at
    'acme/x100/p200'. So when nothing in the store starts with the string,
    it is tried as a run of segments anywhere inside a path, and every
    branch it names becomes a scope.

    Two deliberate properties. The literal reading always wins: if 'p200'
    also exists as a top-level domain, that is what a filter on 'p200'
    means, and the routine buried elsewhere is not silently mixed in. And
    an ambiguous name broadens instead of guessing -- a code filed under
    two modules resolves to both scopes, and callers are told which
    (`scope.paths` in pulse(), `domain_scope` in the admin responses),
    because picking one silently is the failure this exists to avoid.

    Returns the requested path unchanged when nothing matches, so an
    unknown domain still means "no rows" rather than "everything".

    Cross-listings count as paths in use on both readings: a subject that
    exists only because memories were cross-listed into it is a real scope,
    and it resolves literally like any other.

    Casing is not part of either reading. The store's policy is applied
    first, so a store that coerces to one case resolves a filter written in
    the other; and both passes then match folded (see _fold), because a
    'preserve' store keeps whatever spelling each write happened to use and
    a caller has no way to know which one that was. Every scope returned is
    a path as STORED. `LIKE` ignores case and `=` does not, so a scope

    Returns every memory's curation-relevant fields plus the relation edges
    touching them, so the agent can spot missing links, duplicates, stale or
    mis-scoped rows without hundreds of individual reads.

    The listing is aggressively slimmed so a few-hundred-memory store fits
    one MCP response (the full-body version of a real 200-memory store was
    ~450KB; even snippet-only it overflowed on metadata alone):
      - content is a snippet with content_len alongside (full=True keeps
        whole bodies; get_memory fetches one on demand)
      - tags longer than CORPUS_TAGS_LEN are cut, with tags_len alongside
      - empty/default fields are omitted (blank domain/session/tags, no
        cross-listings, null superseded_by, status matching the filter
        default, confidence 'unverified' -- stats.by_confidence keeps the
        aggregate view)
      - `also` lists the domains a memory belongs to besides its own path,
        because a pass proposing a `crosslist` has to be able to tell a new
        membership from one that already holds
      - created_at drops sub-second precision; updated_at is not listed
        at all (get_memory has it)
      - anchors come as one space-joined string, capped at
        CORPUS_ANCHORS_CAP
    Beyond `limit`, a page also ends early when the serialized listing
    reaches CORPUS_CHAR_BUDGET -- the guarantee is that ONE response
    always fits an MCP host's output cap, whatever the store looks like.
    A `stats` block aggregates the filtered corpus regardless of limit,
    `domain_hints` clusters likely-variant domain strings,
    `domain_nesting` proposes a path for each flat domain that already
    spells a hierarchy out (see _nesting_hints -- the raw material for
    `redomain` suggestions), and `truncated` flags when the listing
    stopped before the corpus ended -- page onward with offset (offset +
    count is the next page's offset).

    `since` makes curation incremental: only memories created OR updated
    at/after the given ISO timestamp (a date like '2026-07-01' works --
    string comparison over ISO values). Stats then describe that delta,
    but domain_hints stay cross-window: clusters are computed over the
    WHOLE store and reported when they touch the delta, so a new
    domain-string variant still pairs with an old spelling that sits
    outside the scan window.
